# FLAC for Windows Runtime

## Examples

This folder contains various examples on how to use FLAC for Windows Runtime in real applications. While these examples are not meant to be fully functional, complete apps, they still may contain a good part of a code that can be copy-pasted to production. The [license](../LICENSE) is the same as for the project itself.
