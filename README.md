FLAC for Windows Runtime
===
**flac-winrt** is a simple Windows Runtime component for decoding (so far) Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) files. It is written completely in C++/CX, and is based on an original C _libFLAC_ library and _libFLAC++_ source code. It is available for C# and C++/CX developers writing Windows Store apps for Windows (Phone) 8.1 and higher.

Current FLAC for Windows Runtime exposes only a decoder as this is what most developers would need in a Windows Store app. But as far as Windows Runtime matures and becomes a technology that is used in desktop development as well, FLAC for Windows Runtime will also update and add necessary functionality.
